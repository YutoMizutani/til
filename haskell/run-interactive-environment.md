## Run interactive environment

> GHCi [1] is GHC’s interactive environment, in which Haskell expressions can be interactively evaluated and programs can be interpreted. If you’re familiar with Hugs, then you’ll be right at home with GHCi. However, GHCi also has support for interactively loading compiled code, as well as supporting all [2] the language extensions that GHC provides. GHCi also includes an interactive debugger (see The GHCi Debugger).
